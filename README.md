[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thanpolas/entity.png)](https://travis-ci.org/thanpolas/entity)

The Entity Object on itself is nothing but an extension of `EventEmitter`. It can be easily extended to create the Interfaces and base classes from where your business logic entities can inherit.

Entities come with a normalized CRUD interface which plugs into [now] two ORM packages, [Mongoose][] and [Sequelize][].
